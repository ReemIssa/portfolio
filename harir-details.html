                  either the administrator can return it to the delegate to edit it or the delegate can pull it to edit it.
                  The administrator can agree or refuse quote then the delegate can make a pdf contains the quote info and send it to the customer and update quote status depending on customer decision
                  And there is a separate activities log to each quote appearing just to the admins to
                  Proceed every edit or every action the delegate makes to the quote
                  mange employees and their custodies and save copies of their إيصال استلام

                  notification system:
                  give notification to each new quote or every action in the quote,
                  the ability to add custom notifications to specific delegates or to all,
                  notifications to tasks assigned by admins or tasks should be done today and display the previous tasks which are not done yet
                  to do list system
